## μFrameworks

### Slim 3.2

- Support the `hostOnly` cookie flag
- Write to the PHP error log if `displayErrorDetails` is false to make it easier to find out what’s gone wrong!
- Support PHP 7+ errors in the same way that Exceptions are handled.

**See:** Slim Framework 3.2 [release notes](http://www.slimframework.com/2016/02/25/slim-3.2.0.html)

## Frameworks

Various frameworks had point releases. I'm not sure what changed, so I assume that these are bugfixes.

- Laravel 5.2.13
  - fixes a bug that can cause `Mail::queue` to send stale view data when using daemon queue workers.
- Symfony [3.0.3, 2.8.3, 2.7.10, 2.3.38]
- Zend Framework
  - No updates for ZF 2.5
  - Lots of work towards ZF 3 in Q3!
    - **See:** the [ZF3 Roadmap](http://framework.zend.com/blog/announcing-the-zend-framework-3-roadmap.html)

## Laravel Homestead

- Homestead 5.2
  - No version change
  - Added [support for MariaDB](https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/homestead#installing-mariadb)

## PHP: The Right Way

- PHP on Windows:
  - Added a [Windows setup resource](http://www.phptherightway.com/#windows_setup) (OpenServer)
  - Chris Tankersley’s blog post about [which tools he uses in Windows](http://ctankersley.com/2015/07/01/developing-on-windows)
- Added an example of a [boolean cast in an if-statement](http://www.phptherightway.com/pages/The-Basics.html#if-statements)
- Added a good idea to keep in mind when [committing configuration files](http://www.phptherightway.com/#configuration_files)
- A few grammar and word-choice updates.
  - **Note:** Every open-source project can use your help with documentation. What are you waiting for?
