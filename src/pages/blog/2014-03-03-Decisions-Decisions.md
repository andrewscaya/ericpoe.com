I am currently feeling a bit of push and pull between at least two different decisions. I have a “when you have time for it” project that I am thinking of building in [Laravel](http://laravel.com/). I am also interested in learning more about the [Dart language](http://dartlang.org/) with Dart’s implementation of [Angular.js](https://angulardart.org/).

Ach! Decisions, decisions.

For my study of Laravel, I am reading (and practicing) Dayle Rees’s [Code Bright](https://leanpub.com/codebright). For my study of Dart, I am running haphazard through various online documentation; yet, I am taking notes and posting them to my [github account](https://github.com/ericpoe/codedoc-dart).

My hope is that I will be able to marry the two disparate projects into one franken-product which will satisfy my brain and, to a lesser-extant, my employer.
