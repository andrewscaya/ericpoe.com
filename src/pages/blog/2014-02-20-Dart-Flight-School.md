This evening, I attended the [Dart Flight School](https://www.dartlang.org/events/2014/flight-school/) at the Google Fiber Space in Kansas City. Dart Flight School is a global event occurring throughout February.

I treated this event as an introduction to the [Dart programming language](https://www.dartlang.org/). I walked in to the event knowing only that Dart was created by Google to be like javascript. What I learned is that Dart is designed to be similar to javascript in that some browsers, like Dartium (a portmanteau of “Dart” and Chromium”) can launch it natively if they have the DartVM; yet for others, for instance all of the currently popular browsers, Dart compiles to a minified javascript.

We looked at a simple text-manipulation application that was very similar to the “[Darrrt](https://www.dartlang.org/codelabs/darrrt/)” introduction to the language. We also ran through building a node.js-like web server using Dart. I’ll see if I can find the code from the presenters and will add a link to it to this post.

The [Dart Editor](https://www.dartlang.org/tools/editor/) is based on the Eclipse IDE, but is not as bulky.

Dart is now on my list of programming languages and libraries to learn.
