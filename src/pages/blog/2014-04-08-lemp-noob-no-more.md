For years, I have prided myself on knowing how to set up a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Perl/Python) server in linux OSes based on Debian, RedHat, and SuSE.

Today, I needed to set up an internal-use survey server using [LimeSurvey](http://www.limesurvey.org/). I decided to build as modern of a server as possible using CentOS, nginx, MySQL, and PHP 5.5 with [Zend OpCache](http://www.php.net/manual/en/intro.opcache.php)â€¦ in short, a LEMP server.

I started out with instruction from [mindfsck.net](http://mindfsck.net/installing-nginx-php-5-5-opcache-mysql-centos-6-lemp/) and went from there.

I must say that building my first LEMP server was much simpler than building my first LAMP server.
