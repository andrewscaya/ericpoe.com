From a [KCPUG](http://kcpug.org/) lightning talk being given on [06 Apr 2016]().

## BASH COMING TO WINDOWS!

Yes, Microsoft is adding the linux Bash shell to Windows.

- Uses Ubuntu user mode binaries
- So, (maybe?) in the Windows Command Line: `apt-get install nginx php7-fpm mysql-server php7-mysql`

PHP development on Windows is about to get much better!
