On Wednesday, I took an extended lunch break in order to take the Zend PHP Certification test at a local Pearson VUE Testing Center.

After a few years of using PHP and studying for a few months, I am a [Zend Certified PHP Engineer](http://www.zend.com/en/yellow-pages/ZEND027285)!

Books that have helped me:

- [Programming PHP, 3rd Ed](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920012443.do) by Kevin Tatroe, Peter MacIntyre, & Rasmus Lerdorf
- [Zend PHP 5 Certification Study Guide, Third Edition](http://www.phparch.com/books/zend-php-5-certification-study-guide-3rd-edition/) by Davey Shafik and Ben Ramsey
- Reviewing the [Zend PHP Certification Study Guide](https://www.zend.com/en/services/certification/php-certification-study-guide) and doing the problems contained within.

People who have helped me along the way:

- My wife.
- My kids.
- My mentor and fellow KCPUG co-organizer, [John Kary](http://johnkary.net)
- KCPUG leader [Dan Holmes](https://twitter.com/dan_holmes/) and the great members of the [KCPUG](http://www.meetup.com/kcphpug/).
- [Cal Evans](http://blog.calevans.com/) and the great speakers at [NomadPHP](https://nomadphp.com/).
- [Adam Culp](http://www.geekyboy.com/) for giving me the push at Lone Star PHP 2014.

Practices that have help me:

- ABC: Alway be coding!
- Added an hour appointment to my calendar every day, after the kids were in bed, to study.
- Watched NomadPHP talks (live, recorded, or [on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYHDBrzJ5o5d97KlCAUhICA))
- Listen to various podcasts about programming, not all about PHP
- Practiced
- Kata
- Present at KCPUG (forced me to really think about the how and why)
- Followed my curiosity in code

These practices and personal connections will continue long after my certification studies ended. I'm looking forward to the next leg of the journey.
